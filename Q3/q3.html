<i><p>You own a license plate manufacturing company. Write a program that takes a population and determines the simplest pattern that will produce enough unique plates. Since all the plates that match the pattern will be generated, find the pattern that produces the least excess plates. Use a combination of letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).  </p></i>
<br>

<p><img src="images/licenseplate.jpg" align="right"/> The lack of boundary conditions in the problem description made some careful analysis necessary prior to building a solution.  Several questions were immediately raised:  even though the base cases (for populations of less than 10, and a population between 11 and 26), other cases - such as a maximum population value, or invalid/negative populations - were less clear as far as program behavior is concerned.  Rules of permutations and combinations - the statistics concepts that make the solution for this problem solveable - are dependent on constraints not given by the problem description. </p>
<br>
<p>  In mathematical definitions: </p>
<br>
<p> <b>Combination:</b> an arrangement of a set of objects where order does not matter</p>
<br>
<p> <b>Permutation:</b> an arrangement of a set of objects in a particular order - in other words, an ordered combination.  In addition, permutations can be calculated in different ways depending on whether repetition of elements (e.g. 11, 22, AAA, etc.) is allowed.</p>
<br>
<p> To solve the license plate problem, both repetition and order are significant, which affects the way possible solutions can be calculated.  Because of this, the formula utilized for computing the total plates generated by each combination of letters and numbers is <i>n<sup>r</sup></i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of items to choose from and <i>r</i> is the number of choices made. In code, this can be computed as follows:</p>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">
	/**
	 * permutationFunctionOrdered Computes number of possible permutations when
	 * order is important and repetition is allowed.
	 * 
	 * @param n
	 * @param r
	 * @return total number of possible permutations as a long value
	 */
	public long permutationFunctionOrdered(long n, long r) {

		return (long) Math.pow(n, r);
	}
</pre>
<br>
<p> Using the mathematical formula above, a number of total plates can be calculated when given a possible number of digits and letters.  Remember that order is significant and repetition is allowed.  </p>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">
        /**
	 * totalPlates returns a value for total number of plates generated given a
	 * number of digits and number of letters
	 * 
	 * @param digits
	 * @param letters
	 * @return total number of possible plates generated based on number of
	 *         digits and letters given
	 */
	public long totalPlates(long digits, long letters) {
		if (digits == 0) {
			return permutationFunctionOrdered(26, letters);
		}
		if (letters == 0) {
			return permutationFunctionOrdered(10, digits);
		}

		return (permutationFunctionOrdered(10, digits) * permutationFunctionOrdered(
				26, letters));
	}

<p>  Due to exponential growth, specifying large populations produces extraordinarily large numbers of plates.  Due to this, some restrictions were specified.  These restrictions can, however, be relaxed as necessary to support larger populations.  All potential solutions are calculated and stored in a list, and then the list is iterated to obtain the "best" solution (smallest number of extra plates) as per the problem description. </p>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">
// assumptions based on trial calculations: 
// 0-9 digits, 0-9 letters
		while (digits < 10) {
			letters = 0;
			while (letters < 10) {
				calculatedPopulation = calcHelper.totalPlates(digits,
						letters);
				combinationList.add(new Combination(letters + " letters, "
						+ digits + " numbers", calculatedPopulation));
				letters++;
			}
			digits++;
