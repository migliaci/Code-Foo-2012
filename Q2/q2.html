<p> Liquid layouts, such as the one this entire submission site is built on, provide several important features necessary to modern web design.  First and foremost, they increase screen real-estate for ads and content.  Secondly, if designed properly, they can scale to all types of different devices - something that is becoming more and more necessary as smartphone and tablet adoption increases.</p>
<br>
<p>Liquid layouts are created by describing elements using percentages of the current browser window's size.  Because page elements are specified in this way, they resize automatically when the size of the window is changed.  Organizing pages using a liquid layout allows for a very efficient use of space many types of browser windows and screen resolutions. They are extremely useful for cases where a lot of information needs to be presented on a site using as little space as possible.</p>
